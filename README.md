# blanc

> A sleek and simple music player

## What is it

Blanc is a music player with a focus on being shiny. Which is why it might bring your PC to it's knees while indexing your music.

Once it's done and you start playing music: Hover over the album art for the play button. Avoid the button and click the image for a nice surprise (and also a major shiny factor.)

## So far it supports

## Todo

1. Playlists
2. Viewing Artists
3. UI Customizability
